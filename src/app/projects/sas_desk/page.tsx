          SAS is a desktop application developed using Electron.js during my
          internship at ISTA Ben Mâ€™Sik. It was built to streamline the
          management of intern absences. This project was a fantastic team
          experience, developed by a group of three using the Scrum methodology
          in an agile environment.
          <br />
          <br />
          We held weekly meetings with the director every Tuesday to evaluate
          progress, gather feedback, and plan upcoming features or changes.
          Although I cannot publicly share the full application details at this
          time, I hope to release a version in the future.
